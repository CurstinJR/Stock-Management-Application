<p>You are asked to write a stock management application for a small stationery
company to facilitate the management of their stock and sales of products. There
are 2 types of users of the system, namely, admin and user.</p>
<p>
Admin can upload all the details of new products that are purchased by the
company, including the name, description, category (business, filing, writing, etc),
quantity, price, etc, to the database. Admin can also add new users to the
database.</p>
<p>
A user can capture details of a customer who has decided to buy products from
the company, and upload to the database. The transaction details must also be
captured in the database.
Design a single-client/server system which maintains a database for the
business.</p>
<p>
The user or admin requests database information and operations via the client
application. The client sends the database request to the server which executes
the request and returns the results of the request back to the client. Only the
server interacts with the database.</p>
